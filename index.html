                <p>Welcome to Forward Fitness Club. Our mission is to help our clients meet their fitness and nutrition goals.</p>
                <p> Fitness is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. It involves more than just going to the gym. Fitness includes physical activities that help our bodies stay strong and active. This can be anything from playing sports to walking or even dancing.</p>
                <p> When we engage in regular physical activity, our bodies become better at using energy, which is essential for our daily tasks. Staying fit also helps improve our mood and keep our minds sharp. </p>

                        <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel.</p>
